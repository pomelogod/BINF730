Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning


This notebook analyzes a breast cancer dataset to classify tumors as benign or malignant using machine learning techniques. It includes detailed exploratory data analysis with violin plots, box plots, and swarm plots to visualize feature distributions across diagnosis classes. After preprocessing and feature standardization, the project applies classification algorithms and evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices. The workflow demonstrates an end-to-end biomedical data analysis pipeline suitable for diagnostic prediction in clinical settings.
